Hadoop is an open source framework that allows us to store & process large dta sets in a parallel & distributed manner. 
Node = 128 MB 
Two main components HDFS (Hadoop distributed file system is the primry data storage system used by hadoop applications) & MapReduce (used for processing).
Name Node (Master node, it stores metadata (data related information), Data Node(slave node).
It has 3 replicatin factor for fault tolerance.
Rack is a physical collection of various nodes, generally 30-40 nodes under one rack.
YARN = manage resource, schedule jobs 

Yarn is comprised of Resource Manager and Node Manager. There is only one Resource Manager which runs on Master Node. There will be multiple Node Managers running on each Data Node. Resource Manager deals with resource management to execute any Job/Application.

1) How will you measure HDFS space consumed?
The two popular utilities or commands to measure HDFS space consumed are hdfs dfs –du and hdfs dfsadmin –report. 
HDFS provides reliable storage by copying data to multiple nodes. The number of copies it creates is usually referred to as the replication factor which is greater than one.
hdfs dfs –du –This command shows the space consumed by data without replications.
hdfs dfsadmin –report- This command shows the real disk usage by considering data replication.


2) Is it a good practice to use HDFS for multiple small files?
It is not a good practice to use HDFS for multiple small files because NameNode is an expensive high performance system. Occupying the NameNode space with the unnecessary amount of metadata generated for each of the small multiple files is not sensible. If there is a large file with loads of data, then it is always a wise move to use HDFS because it will occupy less space for metadata and provide optimized performance.

3) I have a file “Sample” on HDFS. How can I copy this file to the local file system?
This can be accomplished using the following command -
bin/hadoop fs -copyToLocal /hdfs/source/path /localfs/destination/path


4) What do you understand by Inodes?
HDFS namespace consists of files and directories. Inodes are used to represent these files and directories on the NameNode. Inodes record various attributes like the namespace quota, disk space quota, permissions, modified time and access time.
